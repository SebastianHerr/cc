## How To
### Testing
To run the tests you need to call the main method in the class TestMain with following parameters:
```
parameters: * [print] [cma]
```
The `*` is the filter about which tests are being run

In case of successful tests it will end with following line:
```
  #####################################################
  All tests passed
```
and if some of the tests failed outside of their test scope then it will end with:
```
  #####################################################
  Following tests failed:
  [List of failed tests]
```
The optional parameter `print` enables expanded debug output.
The optional parameter `cma` enables the output of each step of the cma execution (Warning can be very long output)

It's possible to only test a subset of the tests with filters.
The wildcard is the standard way to select which tests to run. The matching is run against [name of the testfolder eg. "01parsing"]/[name of the test]
To only run test which should pass you can run the following first parameter:
```
parameters: *_pass*
```
To only run test which should are in the type checking you can run the following first parameter:
```
parameters: 03*
```

### Naming of the tests
All names for the tests are following this naming convention. 
With that naming convention the building script can check if a test should pass and 
with the proper placement inside the test folders it can also correctly check where it failed and if the test was going good enough
```
[3 digit test ID]_[pass/fail]_[testname without any underscores].c0
```
If a test should also test the return value of the output of the CMA machine then there is another field put after the pass/fail looking like this:
```
[3 digit test ID]_[pass/fail]_[return value of CMA]_[testname without any underscores].c0
```
